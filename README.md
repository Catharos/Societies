#Societies ![build](https://travis-ci.org/Catharos/Societies.svg) ![wtfpl](http://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl-badge-1.png) [![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/societies/localized.png)](https://crowdin.com/project/societies)

## Motivation

Societies is a revived version of the original [SimpleClans](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/simpleclans/) and is targeted to support a wide range of minecraft servers.
At the moment Societies only supports Bukkit, but as new server implementations come up support will be added.


## Getting started

To get started, just contact me over at [esper.net](http://esper.net/publicirc.php) @ #SimpleClans.


## Special libraries

The backend library for grouping is [clib-group](https://github.com/Catharos/clib-groups), which provides a simple api to group members to groups. For basic actions and helpers [clib-core](https://github.com/Catharos/clib-core) will be used. clib-core contains functionality like commands, futures or special collections.
The glue for all components is [google guice](https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/), a lightweight dependency injection framework.


## Installation

If you're familiar with [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/), you're probably also familiar with the installation of plugins. Look [here](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Installing_Plugins) for some more information.

The latest build can be downloaded [here](http://build.frederik-schmitt.de/).

## Usage

Will follow.


## Compilation

We use maven to handle our dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Check out this repo and: `mvn clean install`


## Contributing

Currently, me - p000ison (Max A.) - is the only person who's working on this project, but this will hopefully change after release. You can contact me over at irc.esper.net @ #SimpleClans
